Dual-Miner-Protocol Software Bio

Dual-Miner-Protocol is an open-source, community-driven dual mining platform designed for Windows 11 that enables simultaneous mining of Monero (XMR) and a custom Radio Token (RADIO) on parallel blockchains.

Leveraging the powerful RandomX algorithm through the well-established XMRig miner, this system integrates a lightweight Radio Token miner that rewards participants with 100 RADIO tokens every 2 minutes based on their mining share contribution. This innovative dual-mining setup allows miners to earn traditional cryptocurrency rewards while supporting a novel radio wave–based blockchain ecosystem with an unlimited token supply.

Key features include:

Seamless integration with official XMRig for Monero mining without modification

A parallel Radio Token miner that runs concurrently to allocate proportional token rewards

Automated payout cycles with community control potential

A sample ERC-20 mintable smart contract to deploy and manage Radio Token supply

Modular architecture including a launcher, payout bot, and clear configuration files

Designed for transparency, decentralization, and scalability


This platform empowers users to participate in a next-generation blockchain ecosystem bridging traditional crypto mining and emerging radio wave–based tokenomics.
